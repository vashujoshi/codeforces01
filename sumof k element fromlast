This formula gives you the maximum sum achievable by selecting k numbers from the range n to 1, and it represents the sum of the numbers n, n-1, n-2, ..., n-(k-1).

In summary, the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 - (n - k) * (n - k + 1) / 2 calculates the maximum sum of k numbers within the range from n to 1.
